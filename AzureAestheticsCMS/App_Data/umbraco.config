We advise once or twice Bioslimming Wrap a week.To achieve maximum results we recommended 6 to 10 sessions, if this is combined with the use of the Bioslimming Trio at home between salon treatments optimum results can be achieved.</p>
<h5>Will I Lose Weight with Bioslimming?</h5>
<p>Yes you can lose weigh using Bioslimming. This is due to the fact that Bioslimming works differently from other inch loss wraps as it is fat that is removed as opposed to just toxins and as such many clients lose 1- 2lbs following first treatment and many losing an average of 7lbs following a course of 6 treatments.</p>
<h5>Is Bioslimming just like all the other wraps on the market?</h5>
<p>Bioslimming wrap is an absolute revolution in body wraps.It contains a high concentration of active ingredients. Bioslimming wrap is not a based on “compression” and is not based on temporary water loss. The inch loss you get from our process are PERMANENT as long as you don’t gain weightIt is an “all in one wrap” – Detoxing, Slimming, Firming, Toning, Inch Loss, Combats Cellulite, Reduces Appearance of Stretch Marks &amp; Spider Veins and much more</p>
<h5>Are The Inches that are lost due to Water Loss?</h5>
<p>No. Bioslimming uses active ingredients to induce Lipolysis – fat burning below the surface of the skin. Following the treatment you will be advised to drink plenty of water to assist in the detoxification process.</p>
<h5>How Does It Reduce The Appearance Of Cellulite?</h5>
<p>Bioslimming draws the fluid out from between the cells, it enhances the production of collagen which helps support the cells, and it increases the peripheral circulation all of which are required to help tackle the appearance of cellulite.</p>
