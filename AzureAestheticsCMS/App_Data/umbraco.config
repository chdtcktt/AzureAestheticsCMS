    <aboutUs><![CDATA[<p>My goal at Azure is for you to find a skin care technician who is passionate, informed and observant.<br /> I believe that visible skin regeneration needs powerful directed tools that inspire a natural sustainable response that you can continue at home.<br /> It’s my belief beautiful skin doesn't come from overuse or over-sale of products of any kind. I believe in viewing the skin and body as an environment<br /> which we must protect, restore and not harm with artificial chemicals, aggressive acids or artificial colors.<br /> Skin care is problem solving, and one size doesn't fit all, professional skin care is an art and at Azure your skin is our obsession.</p>]]></aboutUs>
